# Different types of testing: 

## Unit Testing: 

- Unit testing is the practice of testing small pieces of code, typically individual functins, alone and isolated. 

- If a test uses some external resources, like the network or a database, it's not a unit test. 
- Examples of unit testing tools: Mocha, Jasmine, and Tape. 

## Integration Testing: 

- testing how parts of the system work together - an integration of the parts. 
- You should have fewer integration tests than unit tests. 
- Use these when need to test 2 separate systems together, or if a pieace of code is too complext to unit test. 

## Functional testing:

- Also called E2E testing or browser testing. Same thing. 
- Testing the complete functionality of the application. 
- Using some tool to automate the browser. 
- Only a small amount of functional tests. 
- These are hard to maintain due to high complexity but also run very slowly. 

- Examples: Selenium. Protractor. 

# Mocha and Chai

Mocha is the library that allows us to run tests and chai contains some helpful functions that we'll use to verify our results. 

For Node, you donâ€™t need the test runner file.
To include Chai, add var chai = require('chai'); at the top of the test file.
